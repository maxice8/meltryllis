# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use 'alacritty' if it is
  # available, otherwise 'xterm-256color' is used.
  TERM: alacritty

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#   - hintstyle
#   - antialias
#   - lcdfilter
#   - rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to `none`. If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to `false`.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig:
#   - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/font_configuration#Fontconfig_configuration
#   - file:///usr/share/doc/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html
font:

    style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 8.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Scale the font size based on the monitor's DPI. This will lead to bigger text on HiDPI
  # screens and make reading text a little easier.
  # On X11 it is possible to change the DPI for each instance of alacritty by using
  # `WINIT_HIDPI_FACTOR=1.0 alacritty` to scale the font.

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.

#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once

# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
