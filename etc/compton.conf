# WINDOW_TYPE is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop", "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu", "tooltip", "notify", "combo", and "dnd". "fade" and "shadow" controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings. "opacity" controls default opacity of the window type. "focus" controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused. (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
